          I try to maintain my programming blog. Most of it is code review /
          code reflection of my own projects. I maintain this blog through
          WordPress.

        <p>
          I also sometimes write about some other topics that interest. These
          incldue the inner workings of retro games, game consoles, analog video
          signals and software optimazation.
